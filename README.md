# Arduino-Calculator
A calculator using a 16x2 LCD with an Arduino Nano as the logic unit.
-
- It utilized 5 buttons and a potentiometer as inputs.

- The way it works is by adjusting the potentiometer to certain levels that will highlight certain numbers to be inserted,
and to insert them, the "place number button" will need to be pressed.

- To switch to operators, press the operator button and to insert a highlighted operator, press the operator button again.

- To go back to number placement, press the place number button.

- The delete, clear and equals buttons do what their names imply.

- The following is the circuit presented using the Fritzing app and a picture of the actual board in real life:
